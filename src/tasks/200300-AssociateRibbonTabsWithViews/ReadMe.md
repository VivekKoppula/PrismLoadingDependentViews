# Basic example of Tab Control. 
- This builds from the previous example. 
- Add a new core project and in it, define a new class RibbonTabAttribute.
- Add two new RibbonViews for RibbonTabs. 
- Now apply this attriubte to the ViewA and ViewB.
- Now build.
- So now by this attribute, we are associating the viewA with its corresponding Ribbon tab ViewATab.

- Now run.
